DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW:

This project involves developing a simple synchronous RAM module that supports read and write operations. The design is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and ensures synchronized memory access using a clock signal.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Implement a synchronous RAM module with read and write functionality. Ensure data is stored and retrieved correctly. Use a clock signal to synchronize operations.

DELIVERABLES:

✅ RAM Module Verilog/VHDL Code ✅ Testbench for Functional Verification ✅ Simulation Demonstrating RAM Functionality

INSTRUCTIONS:

Clone this repository. Compile the code using an HDL simulator (ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, etc.). Run the testbench to verify RAM read/write operations. Analyze the simulation results.
